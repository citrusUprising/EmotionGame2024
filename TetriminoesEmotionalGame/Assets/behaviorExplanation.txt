Characters will by default recite each symbol in their opening in order
If the player responds with a compound symbol during the opening affection decreases
Once the opening is finished, they will recite one of the symbols from their standard list randomly
"waits" determines if they wait for player input between symbols

If the player says any variation of X, the character will respond based on affection, then end the conversation

If the olayer says any of the inputs in the character's special cases, the character will respond with the given output, and have their affection changed by the respective "affect"
NOTE: SPECIAL CASES SUPERCEDE ALL OTHER INTERACTIONS, PAUSING OPENING AND CANCELING X VALUES WHEN THEY ARE THE INPUT
